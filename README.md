# K-means-clustering-from-scratch
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
Task:
Imagine if a computer could automatically group similar things together in a massive dataset, without
being told what those groups are. That's exactly what K-means clustering does – it's like magic for
data!

Have you ever wondered how Netflix suggests movies or how your smartphone sorts your photos? K-
means clustering is one of the secrets behind these recommendations and organization.

Picture a scenario where a computer learns to classify animals based on their features without being
given any labels – K-means can do that! It's like teaching a computer to think like a biologist.
a.) Perform K-means clustering on MNIST data from scratch. Instead of using Euclidian distance as
distance metric use Cosine Similarity as distance metric. Clustering should be done in 10, 7, and
4 clusters.
b.) Visualize the images getting clustered in different clusters.
c.) Please comment on the cluster characteristics. 
d.) Try to write a python function which finds optimal number of clusters for this dataset?
